General "screen" structure: 
(Base)\1) Quality control\ (Cell Line)\(Numerated assay batch)\
These files contained in each one of these sub-folders show various assay quality control metrics for each assay plate tested with in that batch of experimentation.
	Growth Chart – A graph showing the growth of off-plate day 0, and endpoint cell counts
	Assay plate delta – A graph showing the absolute difference in the median value of the positive and negative controls
	Assay plate CV – A graph showing the coefficient of variance of the positive and negative controls for each assay plate 
	DRC_(Drug name) – A graph showing the fitted dose response curve for a reference toxic control used to establish intra- and inter-batch reproducibility/drift in assay performance.
	(Cell Line)_Run(Batch ID)_Tabular Data.xlsx – Excel file with embedded heatmaps showing the plate view of the response. This is used to quickly visually confirm that no positional artifacts have occurred. Additional plate statistics are also contained in this file.
	Leveled analysis
This is the archival data structure of the screening data. It is generated by reshaping the primary read-outs from the various instrumentation and combining it with the established metadata. The general file structure of this folder is:
(Base)\2) Leveled analysis\ (Cell Line)\(Level of analysis)\
	Level 1 (Lvl_1) – These data are still sub-divided by the file structure which reflects the experimental batch. With-in each sub-directory each plate is stored as individual CSV files where the file name is reflective of the plate barcode. At this point, no outlier detection of other QC metrics have been applied. Key terms in these files are as follows:
	Cmpd1 – The name of the compound with in the well
	Cmpd2 – The name of the second compound with-in the well. This value is only present in combination screens. The order of Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 may vary, likewise if one is regenerating higher levels of data it may be important to pivot combination names.
	Conc1 – The concentration of Cmpd1
	Conc2 – The concentration of Cmpd2
	Func – A function code describing the experimental function of the well
	Pos – Positive control
	Neg – Negative control
	MSR/DRC/CRC – On-plate dose response curve for MSR analysis
	Sing – Single agent
	Sing_qHTS – Cross-plate concentration curve for anchors run in [q2]-HTS assay
	Sing_DRC – On-plate anchor dose response curve for anchor
	Sing_OPC – Off-plate anchor dose response curve for anchor
	Comb – Combination treatment
	Count – The cell count from the image analysis file
	Count_FA – The fraction affect defined as:
FA=1-〖Count〗_ij/(Median 〖Count〗_DMSO )
	Count_RZ – The robust Z-score defined as:
RZ=(〖Count〗_ij-〖Median Count〗_DMSO)/〖MAD〗_DMSO 
	Count_Unit – The range normalized count defined as:
RZ=(〖Count〗_ij-〖Median〗_Neg)/(〖Median〗_Pos 〖-Median〗_Neg )
	Count_GRI – The Hafner growth rate index defined as:
GRI= 2^(log_2⁡〖(〖Count〗_ij/〖Count〗_0)〗/log_2⁡〖(〖Count〗_DMSO/〖Count〗_0)〗 )-1
	Level 2 (Lvl_2) – This data is reshaped to resemble the final output (e.g. composed dose response curves/surfaces). At this point, a combination of manual curation and automated outlier detection is performed to remove confounded wells.
	Single agent screens - The log concentration was fitted to the normalized response (typically FA and GRI values) using a cascade model which leverages iteratively reweighted least squared to fit the response surface to an unconstrained 4-parameter logistic, constrained 2 and 3 parameter logistic equations and finally linear models. For dose response curves fit using FA values the AUC_FA, and IC50 are used as dense descriptors of response. For GRI derived curves, AUC_GRI, AOC_GR, AOC_LD, LD50, and GR50 are used as dense descriptors.
	Combination screens - A bliss independence model was used to calculate drug synergy. To fulfill the statistical requirements of this model, raw cell count data is normalized from 0 (in-active) to 1 (Full-active) using the FA method described above. To minimize the detection of false positives due to assay artifacts or the presence of outliers, we fitted the 2-dimensional combination surface using an SVM in R. The predicted bliss surface is then calculated from the fitted single agent curves and the differential volume between surfaces is used as the ultimate read-out of synergy.
